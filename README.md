Projection of 3D objects to a 2D plane.
Also, a Matrix library from my other assignment is used.

Objects are transformable (can be moved, rotated, resized).
The objects are:
	- a frustum;
	- a Bezier surface: a surface comprised of 16 individual points that dictate how the curves, that form the surface, should be drawn.
		Each point is individualy movable, what affects the plane.
